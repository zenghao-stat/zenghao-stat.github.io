> Heterogeneity nourishes statistics; independence begets probability; uncertainty is eternal.

I am currently a Postdoctoral in Statistics at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) and National University of Singapore (NUS), Department of Statistics and Data Science, supported by the SUSTech-NUS Joint Research Program, supervised by **[Prof. Bingyi Jing](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/zh/faculties/jingbing-yi.html)**, **[Prof. Hongxin Wei](https://hongxin001.github.io/)**, and **[Prof. Wang Zhou](https://www.stat.nus.edu.cn/wang-zhou/)**. I received my PhD in Statistics from Gregory and Paula Chow Institute for Studies in Economics, Xiamen University in 2024, where I was advised by **[Prof. Wei Zhong](https://faculty.xmu.edu.cn/wzhong/zh_CN/index/559037/list/index.htm)**, with **[Prof. Xingbai Xu](https://faculty.xmu.edu.cn/XXB/zh_CN/index.htm)** and **[Prof. Tuo Liu](https://faculty.xmu.edu.cn/LT1234/zh_CN/index/582397/list/index.htm)** as co-advisors. During 2018-2020, I completed my academic master's courses in Quantitative Economics at Wang Yanan Institute for Studies in Economics before transferring to the PhD program in Statistics. I was a visiting researcher at the Department of Statistics, National University of Singapore (NUS) from May to October 2023. I completed my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics ([Peng's Class: Base of Financial Mathematics&Financial Engineering](https://www.math.sdu.edu.cn/info/1026/1612.htm)) at Shandong University in 2018. 

My research focuses on **statistical machine learning theory, methods, and their applications on uncertainty quantification**, particularly developing novel methodologies that bridge statistical theory with practical applications. I am also interested in interdisciplinary research at the intersection of machine learning methodologies with **spatial statistics**, **econometrics**, and **biostatistics**.
