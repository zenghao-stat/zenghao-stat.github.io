excerpt: "Introductory probability course covering sample spaces, random variables, distributions, expectation, limit theorems, and basic statistical inference."
---

This course introduces fundamental concepts of probability, including sample spaces and events, conditional probability, independence, and Bayesâ€™ theorem.
It covers discrete and continuous random variables, common distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Normal), joint distributions, expectation, variance, covariance, and moment generating functions.
Foundational limit theorems such as the Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem are discussed, with applications to basic statistical inference.
