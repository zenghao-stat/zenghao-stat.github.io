This course introduces the rigorous foundations of analysis, emphasizing precise definitions and proofs.
Core topics include limits and continuity for functions of one variable, differentiation and the mean value theorem, sequences and series of real numbers, uniform convergence, and an introduction to metric spaces.
Students develop skills in constructing and understanding mathematical proofs, which are essential for advanced courses in probability, statistics, and functional analysis.
