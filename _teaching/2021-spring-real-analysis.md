This course provides a rigorous introduction to real functions and measure theory.  
It covers Lebesgue measure and integration, convergence theorems, Lp spaces, and the Radonâ€“Nikodym theorem, together with the basic properties of measurable functions and sets.  
The focus is on developing the theoretical foundation essential for modern probability, stochastic processes, and advanced statistical inference.

As a teaching assistant (TA), my responsibilities included grading assignments, leading exercise sessions and supplementary tutorials, grading midterm and final exams, and providing regular Q&A support and office hours.
